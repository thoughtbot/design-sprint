# Product Design Sprint

This repo is a collection of documents intended to help guide a design sprint.
It contains guidelines that should not be followed exactly.
Each sprint should be tailored to the individual project.
It is written by and for the thoughtbot team.

## What is a product design sprint?

A product design sprint is a technique to
quickly solve product design problems
and test the viability of a solution.

#### Why do a design sprint?

A design sprint orients the team
and aims our efforts toward a mutual goal.
Design thinking and product design sprints
keep us on target
and invest our time and money wisely.

Sprints are useful when kicking off a new
business, product, feature, or workflow.
Sprints can also be used to solve problems with an existing product.

#### What should you expect to have at the end of a design sprint?

At the end of the sprint,
the team will understand the problem and
will have validated
whether we have a viable solution to begin building
or whether we need to run another sprint to keep searching for a solution.

## Design Sprint Overview

A design sprint is comprised of five phases;
Understand, Diverge, Converge, Prototype and Test.
Each phase typically lasts one day.

#### [Pre-Sprint](0-Pre-Sprint)

We should not start a sprint
without defining a "job to be done"
as the focus of the sprint.
The "job to be done" may evolve during the sprint
into a problem statement agreed upon by the whole team,
but without one as a starting point
our client is not ready and should not be paying us.

#### [Understand Phase](1-Understand)

The Understand phase
develops a common understanding
of the context within which we are working
and all the elements in that context:
the customer,
their job to be done,
and the business our client hopes to support by servicing the job to be done.
We want to expose risky knowledge gaps and assumptions
so we can make plans to reduce those risks
and move forward with confidence.

#### [Diverge Phase](2-Diverge)

The Diverge phase
generates insights and concepts for solutions.
Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible,
regardless of how feasible or viable.
Insights are born from this explosion of possibilities
by considering the implications of
radically different approaches to solving a problem.
These insights can become
valuable differentiating forces
and the source of
inspiration for unique solutions.

#### [Converge Phase](3-Converge)

The Converge phase
takes all the possibilities generated over the past two phases
and hones in on a single version
to prototype
and test with existing or potential customers.
By exploring and eliminating so many options,
we have reason to be more confident in our choices.

#### [Prototype Phase](4-Prototype)

The Prototype phase
develops a prototype
that fills our riskiest knowledge gaps and assumptions.
Paper prototypes,
Keynote prototypes,
Flinto prototypes,
and
static HTML/CSS pages
are all valid mediums.
The medium
should be determined by
our time constraints
and learning goals.

#### [Test Phase](5-Validate)

The Test phase
tests our prototype
with existing or potential customers.
By the end of this phase,
we should have validated or invalidated
our riskiest knowledge gaps and assumptions
and have confidence in our next steps.
