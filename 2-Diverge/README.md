# Diverge: Illuminating all possible paths

Phase two of the design sprint is about generating insights and solution
concepts. Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless
of how realistic, feasible or viable they may or may not be.

From this explosion of opportunity comes insights made when considering the
implications of radically different perspectives on and approaches to solving a
problem. These insights can become valuable differentiating forces and the
source of unique solution inspiration. Also, once we begin eliminating as many
of these options as possible we are given reason to be more confident in the
options we do move forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

## Objectives for Diverge

Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how

* Have a mindset of "Yes and"
* Constantly ask “How might we?”

### Suggested Activities for Diverge

These are the core of the [Google Ventures Design Sprint Diverge
Day](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-divergeday2).
They go through each of these exercises in the oder that they appear
and expect ideas to build upon each other while doing them. It is best to split
up the [Critical path](../Exercises/critical-path.md) into 
stand alone parts and do this cycle for each part.

#### [Mind Mapping](../Exercises/mind-mapping.md)

A warm up exercise to start generating ideas. People are given time to
individually explore the problem however they choose to.

#### [Crazy Eights](../Exercises/crazy-eights.md)

Crazy eights are meant to generate a lot of ideas really quickly. With a forced
time limit for each sketch people need to think quickly. Doing this exercise
repetitively generates a lot of varied  ideas.

#### [Story Boards](../Exercises/storyboards.md)

This exercise mimics a movie storyboard. You'll be drawing a flow for the user
by using Post-its as frames and writing out out a description next to it.

#### [Silent Critique](../Exercises/silent-critique.md)

This critique exercise is a way to get everyones input in a short amount of
time. At the end of the exercise you'll have a heat map of the ideas people find
really interesting.

#### [Group Critique](../Exercises/group-critique.md)

This critique exercise is more open and allows for a more detailed conversation.
It gives the person that came up with the idea to add any remaining details or
correct any wrong interpretations.

#### Additional Activities for Diverge

### [3-12-3](../Exercises/3-12-3.md)

3-12-3 is a good way to generate ideas in a big group and then start to converge
them down. It is great to do after the Google Ventures Diverge Cycle when there
seems to be more ideas and no really strong direction forward.
