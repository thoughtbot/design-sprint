# Prototype: Quickly build the right path

The core purpose of the prototype, the assumptions you are trying to
validate/invalidate or the knowledge gaps you are trying to fill should have all
been discussed in [Converge](../3-Converge). During this phase you will build a
quick and dirty prototype. Since you only have at most a day to build the
prototype it should be as low-fi as you can get away with during [Testing](../5-Test).

During this phase roles shift. Designers are typically the ones building the
prototype unless it is low-fi enough for everyone to contribute
(see: [Keynote](#keynote) or [Paper Prototype](#paper-prototype)).
Product Owners should be in charge of getting
realistic information, data and copy into the prototype.
It should be clear what everyone's role is
before the phase starts.
The team should check in with each other as much as possible
to make sure everything is on the right track.

## Activities for Prototype

#### HTML & CSS

HTML & CSS prototypes tend to be the most time consuming but are best for
heavier web interactions like filling out forms.
Use [Proteus](https://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus)
for a starting point and quickly host on GitHub pages.

#### [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com/)

Invision really great for being able to take mockups from Photoshop or Sketch and
allow for users to click through to different states or pages. Invision allows
for you to create a simple image map for your users. Because it takes mockups it
allows for you to create designs that look more visually appealing or visually
complete.

#### [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/)

The traditional [Google Ventures
prototype](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-prototypeday4),
Keynote is great for a low-fi click through prototype similar to Invision.
Keynote allows for really great animations and transitions.
Because it is Keynote and not a graphical editor there is a
limit to the visual design you can do.
If you are going to use Keynote for prototyping use a
template like [Keynotopia](http://keynotopia.com/)
to speed up your design process.

#### [Paper Prototype](http://alistapart.com/article/paperprototyping)

Paper prototyping is as low-fi as you can get for a prototype.
It is especially useful when you are
under a time crunch to produce a prototype.
It also allows for the whole team to contribute.
Because the prototype is sketches on paper you are relying
much more on the imagination of the participant.
It gives you the ability to prototype on the fly,
even during the session with the participant.
Tools like [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/apps) 
and [POP](https://popapp.in/) can help
present sketches on a mobile device
or in the browser so that it seems more real.

## Case Study

### [Great Engagements](http://greatengagements.herokuapp.com/)

> Our prototype is much higher-fidelity than a prototype would typically be, but
> that was somewhat necessary for testing our hypothesis.

> Before couples can address the details of planning a wedding
(decoration, guests, caterers, dress, etc.), couples usually have to decide on a
location and venue. The couple is filled with excitement; as the wedding day
will usher forth a new life for the couple together. However, the couple might
experience a bit of uncertainty as to how even to proceed planning their
wedding. We want to capture couples at their “excitement” period and put aside
all uncertainty and potential anxiety that the wedding planning process may
cause. A customer’s initial engagement with our website should parallel his/her
engagement with the wedding process in general.

> With our prototype, we want to evaluate our ability to capture the excitement of
a recently engaged person and leverage that excitement to create engagement with
our website.
