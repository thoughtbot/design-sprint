## Example Schedule for Validate

#### 4 User Interviews *(1hr each)*

* Intro user to usability test *(5 - 10min)*
* Ask user research questions
* Our Prototype *(5 - 10min)*
* Recap & Prep for next interview *(10min)*

#### Consolidate Notes *(30min)*

At the end of all of the Interviews, gather everyone that watched and compare
notes. Figure out where your assumptions were validated and where assumptions
might have been invalidated. Decide whether you've validated enough to start
building the application or start another sprint.

#### Write Sprint Summary *(30min)*
