# Test & Learn: Test the right path

Reactions to competitive demos, our assumptions for the prototype, what we were
looking for and the reactions to the prototype.
Going into each test you should have a plan of what you are testing and how you
know if that is successful or not. This is best achieved through a [Assumption /
Test table](../Exercises/assumptions.md)

## Activities for Validate and Learn

#### Gorilla Usability Testing

This is the most used form of testing. Bring in 4–6 potential users and show
them the prototype that you made. Pay close attention to problems that they have
and be sure to follow a script to cover the assumptions that you are testing.
With their permission you can record these but it's best to see them as they happen.

#### [Closed Card Sorting](../Exercises/card-sorting.md)

A design exercise that guides us toward creating the most coherent
information architecture of a product.
During a card sorting session,
participants are asked to associate two sets
of flashcards by grouping them.

#### Survey Test

This is a good way to reach a bunch of potential users and see their answers.
Create a simple form with [Google Forms](http://www.google.com/forms/about/)
or [Formkeep](https://formkeep.com/).
Post the form to forums or other places that would have ideal users on it.
Make sure the form is easy to fill out
and open ended enough to collect qualitative information.

#### Fake landing page

To judge interest create a fake landing page with email collection.
This could be something as simple
as a [Launchrock](http://launchrock.co/) page
or a [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/) site or a
completely custom site with a [Formforge](https://formkeep.com/) form
for email collection. Run Google analytics and see how many people sign up and
how many people visit.

## Case study

> Example: “Connie supplied us with three interviewees (2 were done online, 1 in
person; 1 was recently married). Though the dataset was limited due to the
background and interest of those we interviewed, we gained some important
insight to help us build a superior wedding planning product. People’s
complaints about competing wedding sites, such as The Knot, Wedding Wire, and
Offbeat Bride, were about the lack of focus on those websites (too
disorganized, too much information). They were most engaged by browsing things
like wedding dresses, cakes  etc.

> While it is important for any newly engaged person to gain access to important
information about the wedding planning process, some of these websites
provided stress and anxiety as much as they did excitement about the “Big
Day.” Furthermore, while acknowledging that the first step in their processes
might be to contact friends and to think about location, these other websites
presented an overwhelming wealth of information (such as on decoration and
wear) that might be more informative later on in a couple’s wedding planning
process after they have chosen the wedding location and venue.

> The primary assumption we were testing for with our prototype was that we will
be able to create an engaging, exciting an emotional experience that gets
people fantasizing about their wedding through images, storytelling and high
quality information. We chose to test for this because we believe that if we
can engage and pull customers into the product in this way, we may be able to
more successfully introduce rational planning, communication tools, and
premium services once they move further down the engagement funnel. Through
competitive analysis we also identified this emotional/aspirational experience
as a means of differentiation in the market.

> When shown the Great Engagements Prototype, the users were engaged with the
mad-libs functionality and with the large, eye-catching images that create our
demo website (http://greatengagements.herokuapp.com/). They understood right
away that the website is about venue discovery and their initial emotional
reactions were that of excitement and inspiration, very much the reactions we
were looking for to validate our primary assumption. These results give us
reason to further pursue our concepts of immersive, inspirational and
aspirational exploration of venues that would ultimately lead customers to
revenue-generating activities.”
