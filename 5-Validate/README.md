## Case study
> Example: “Connie supplied us with three interviewees (2 were done online, 1 in person; 1 was recently married). Though the dataset was limited due to the background and interest of those we interviewed, we gained some important insight to help us build a superior wedding planning product. People’s complaints about competing wedding sites, such as The Knot, Wedding Wire, and Offbeat Bride, were about the lack of focus on those websites (too disorganized, too much information). They were most engaged by browsing things like wedding dresses, cakes  etc.

> While it is important for any newly engaged person to gain access to important information about the wedding planning process, some of these websites provided stress and anxiety as much as they did excitement about the “Big Day.” Furthermore, while acknowledging that the first step in their processes might be to contact friends and to think about location, these other websites presented an overwhelming wealth of information (such as on decoration and wear) that might be more informative later on in a couple’s wedding planning process after they have chosen the wedding location and venue.

> The primary assumption we were testing for with our prototype was that we will be able to create an engaging, exciting an emotional experience that gets people fantasizing about their wedding through images, storytelling and high quality information. We chose to test for this because we believe that if we can engage and pull customers into the product in this way, we may be able to more successfully introduce rational planning, communication tools, and premium services once they move further down the engagement funnel. Through competitive analysis we also identified this emotional/aspirational experience as a means of differentiation in the market.

> When shown the Great Engagments Prototype, the users were engaged with the mad-libs functionality and with the large, eye-catching images that create our demo website (http://greatengagements.herokuapp.com/). They understood right away that the website is about venue discovery and their initial emotional reactions were that of excitement and inspiration, very much the reactions we were looking for to validate our primary assumption. These results give us reason to further pursue our concepts of immersive, inspirational and aspirational exploration of venues that would ultimately lead customers to revenue-generating activities.”
