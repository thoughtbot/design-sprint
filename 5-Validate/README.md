# Validate & Learn: Test the right path

Reactions to competitive demos, our assumptions for the prototype, what we were
looking for and the reactions to the prototype.

## Activities for Validate and Learn

#### [Closed Card Sorting](../Exercises/card-sorting.md)
A design exercise that guides us toward creating the most coherent information architecture of a product. During a card sorting session, participants are asked to associate two sets of flashcards by grouping them.

## Example Schedule for Validate

#### 4 User Interviews *(1hr each)*

* Intro user to usability test *(5 - 10min)*
* Ask user research questions
* Our Prototype *(5 - 10min)*
* Recap & Prep for next interview *(10min)*

#### Consolidate Notes and Write Daily Summary *(30min)

#### Write Sprint Summary (30min)

## Case study

> Example: “Connie supplied us with three interviewees (2 were done online, 1 in
> person; 1 was recently married). Though the dataset was limited due to the
> background and interest of those we interviewed, we gained some important
> insight to help us build a superior wedding planning product. People’s
> complaints about competing wedding sites, such as The Knot, Wedding Wire, and
> Offbeat Bride, were about the lack of focus on those websites (too
> disorganized, too much information). They were most engaged by browsing things
> like wedding dresses, cakes  etc.

> While it is important for any newly engaged person to gain access to important
> information about the wedding planning process, some of these websites
> provided stress and anxiety as much as they did excitement about the “Big
> Day.” Furthermore, while acknowledging that the first step in their processes
> might be to contact friends and to think about location, these other websites
> presented an overwhelming wealth of information (such as on decoration and
> wear) that might be more informative later on in a couple’s wedding planning
> process after they have chosen the wedding location and venue.

> The primary assumption we were testing for with our prototype was that we will
> be able to create an engaging, exciting an emotional experience that gets
> people fantasizing about their wedding through images, storytelling and high
> quality information. We chose to test for this because we believe that if we
> can engage and pull customers into the product in this way, we may be able to
> more successfully introduce rational planning, communication tools, and
> premium services once they move further down the engagement funnel. Through
> competitive analysis we also identified this emotional/aspirational experience
> as a means of differentiation in the market.

> When shown the Great Engagements Prototype, the users were engaged with the
> mad-libs functionality and with the large, eye-catching images that create our
> demo website (http://greatengagements.herokuapp.com/). They understood right
> away that the website is about venue discovery and their initial emotional
> reactions were that of excitement and inspiration, very much the reactions we
> were looking for to validate our primary assumption. These results give us
> reason to further pursue our concepts of immersive, inspirational and
> aspirational exploration of venues that would ultimately lead customers to
> revenue-generating activities.”
