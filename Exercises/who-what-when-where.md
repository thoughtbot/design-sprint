# Who, What, When, Where

**Supplies needed:** Post-Its, Sharpie, Whiteboard

**Estimated time:** 30 min

## Best to use when
Who, What, When, Where is best to use to find out what the different
questions are surrounding a topic or problem.
It helps uncover problems that are underlying or associated with the main
problem statement
It also helps transfer the responsibility of asking the right questions for the
entire sprint team.

It works really well with a large group of people to
get them all on the same page quickly.

## Instructions
1. Divide up the whiteboard into four sections and
give each a title of Who, What, When, and Where.
2. Start with Who.
Each player should write down as many questions 
starting with "Who" related to the problem we want to solve.
e.g. "Who spends hours manually manipulating data from one format to another?"
"Who receives gifts they don't want on their birthday?"
3. Post all the answers under the who section of the whiteboard.
Ask a few players to group similar questions.
4. Have [Product Owner](https://github.com/thoughtbot/design-sprint/tree/master/0-Pre-Sprint#review-roles-for-the-sprint)
or [Facilitator](https://github.com/thoughtbot/design-sprint/tree/master/0-Pre-Sprint#review-roles-for-the-sprint)
answer the questions, mark them later for further research
or reword them as an assumption that needs testing.
5. Repeat for each of the remaining questions
