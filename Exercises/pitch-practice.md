# Pitch Practice

**Supplies needed:** None

**Estimated time:** 5 min

## Best to use when
It's best to practice the pitch several times throughout the sprint, typically
at the beginning of each day.
It makes sure that everyone is staying
in line with the original intent of the sprint
encapsulated in the Problems Statement.
It also allows the Product Owner to
practice and refine the application's elevator pitch.

## Instructions

1. The Product Owner should stand up and walk the sprint team through:
    * What is the Problem Statement / Job-to-be-done?
    * What is the business opportunity?
    * What is the market?
