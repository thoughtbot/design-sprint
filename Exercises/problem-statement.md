# Problem Statement

**Supplies needed:** Whiteboard

**Estimated time:** 20 min

## Best to use when
It is best to identify the job-to-be-done that the sprint
is trying to solve as early in
the process as possible.
Identifying the problem will help to determine
if there is a problem, if that
problem is solvable, and how to solve that problem.
This step will be the first
step to answering this question:
What is this product, and is it useful?

## Instructions

1. The facilitator leads discussion by writing statements on the whiteboard for
   everyone to see.
2. Write down all of the potential problems that the user has.
    * What are all the jobs-to-be-done?
    * What is the problem that this product is going to solve?
    * What is the motivation behind what the user wants?
* As a group decide which problem is the most critical.
* Continue to refine language around the Problem Statement.
* Leave up in a clear visible spot in the room so that it is easy to
   reflect back on.
