# Critical Path

**Supplies needed:** Whiteboard, Markers

**Estimated time:** 15 min

## Best to use when
The Critical Path should be discussed after a
[Problem Statement](problem-statement.md) has been agreed upon.
Once completed, the Critical Path should give a step-by-step map
of the user's most critical experience,
from having the problem to solving the problem,
and every step in-between.

> How do you know which user story is most important? It depends on the problem
you are solving in the sprint. For example:

>
* Helping people understand and get started with your product — you probably
  want to focus on the experience of a user encountering your product for the
  first time.
* Creating a new product concept — you probably want to look into the future and
  imagine the value proposition and core features for an engaged user.
* Improving conversion rate from a landing page — you probably want to
  understand why people land on your page and what their goals are.
* This step can be difficult and time-consuming, but it’s critical!

## Instructions:

1. Starting with the Problem Statement as the first step, as a group,
use your understanding of the Problem Statement to
map out the steps of the user's journey through solving that problem
2. The Facilitator should stand at the whiteboard and draw the flow.
3. Keep adding steps until you've reached a solution.

## Example

The end result often looks like the map of a bus or subway line:
