# Group Critique

**Supplies needed:** None

**Estimated time:** 3 minutes for each sketch

## Best to use when
It is best to do a Group Critique after a Silent critique has already been done.
It allows for in-depth discussion around the idea. It gives time for people to
say what they thought was good about the idea and for the person that had the
idea to add any more detail to the thought.

## Instructions:

1. Everyone gathers around a sketch or [Storyboard](storyboard.md).
* Ask people what they liked about it.
* Ask the person that had the idea to add any more explanation that they think
hasn't been covered or if something was misunderstood.

> Sometimes I like to do this step on a projector, especially if there are a lot
of ideas to get through. Iâ€™ll take photos of each storyboard on my phone, upload
them to Dropbox, put them in a Keynote file, then make notes about parts we like
with outlines and text labels as we go through on the projector. This is easier
for everyone to see, and you have a digital artifact of the ideas for later. The
downside is the setup: count on 15 extra minutes to capture and upload photos.
