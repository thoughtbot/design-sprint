# Back Burner Board

**Supplies needed:** Whiteboard, Markers

**Estimated time:** 30min for review

## Best to use when
We will be generating a lot of ideas throughout the week. Some of the ideas
will be pertinent to the tasks at hand, but others, although interesting, won’t
be. We will capture these good but not immediately relevant ‘back-burner ideas’
on a sticky note board.

## Instructions
1. Have a dedicated space to collect back burner ideas on the whiteboard.
* Throughout the sprint have everyone write down ideas that are not directly
solving the job-to-be-done
and put them up on the whiteboard.
* During Converge, as a team review all the ideas that have been put up on the
wall. Trash any that aren't relevant anymore.
* Record all ideas in a separate document or Trello.
